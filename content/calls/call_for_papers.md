### Submission Instructions

We welcome two types of papers: regular workshop papers and non-archival submissions. Only regular workshop papers will be included in the workshop proceedings. The review process will be double-blind. All submissions should be in PDF format, following the [TBD] template and made through the OpenReview submission portal ([TBD]).
